**About**

Created by a group of people who share a love for music, KC hotSpot is a digital music search service that connects people to local and established artists through live music in the Kansas City metro area.

A responsive web application, KC hotSpot not only allows you to discover when your favorite bands will come to town, but also exposes you to the many unique and often historic concert venues this Midwest city has to offer – and there’s a lot out there!

Better yet, KC hotSpot supports homegrown musicians by carefully curating playlists and giving you an eclectic taste of different genres ranging from garage rock to funk-metal to psychedelic pop and simply good old-fashioned rock and roll!

**Why KC hotspot?**

This is a simpler way for people to find upcoming music performances.

  - Our site is easier and more direct than our competitors
  - Other sites are very busy and have excessive content to absorb
  - We keep it straightforward for a positive user experience
  - We believe a clean and simple design retains customers

KC hotSpot keeps it clean and simple. In fact, you only get two options: where to go (venue) and what to listen to (genre). Click a button or two and your hotSpot is determined for you.
